# AtE-Oceania
After the End: Oceania, a mod for Crusader Kings 2 that takes place in post-apocalyptic Oceania (and eventually Southeast Asia). This is the newest version of this project, a project I've been working on for years (since 2019 or around then). This version is the only one with a complete province map. Anyone has permission to use my work as a starting point if they want to work on their own mod following the same or a similar concept.
